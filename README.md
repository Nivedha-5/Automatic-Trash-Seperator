# Automatic-Trash-Seperator
# Automatic-Trash-Seperator
This is a mini project for environment .
What is ATS ?
  -> Automatic separation of different types of garbage like metal and non-metal.
  -> Automatic open of Trash Bin cover by a hand motion sensor.
  -> Alarm when any of the trash chambers are full.
  -> Automatic spray air freshener after a certain period to maintain fragrance.
  
  Components used 
      -> Arduino UNO
      -> Metal Proximity Sensors
      -> Capacitive Sensor
      -> IR Distance Sensor
      -> Servo Motor
      -> Buffer
      -> Fragrance
      -> Resistors (1K)
      -> Bread Board
      -> Connecting Wires (as required)
      
      
      
Working :
        -> 1st an object will go through a metal sensor, if the metal sensor can detect metal then the metal trash bin door will open. 
        -> Then object will go through both metal and conductive sensors. 
        -> In the second case, the door will open only if the conductive sensor gives a positive result and the metal sensor gives a negative result. 
        -> Either than that it will remain closed.

      
      Advantages :
         -> Less time consumption 
         -> Some wastes can be recycled again .
         -> Protects enviroment as well as human health from foul smell coming from waste .
